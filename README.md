# ESG Report Classification using NLP & Ensemble Learning

## Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Ensemble
Machine Learning to classify companies as Green or Non-Green based on
ESG reports.

## Problem Statement

Traditional investment analysis emphasizes financial metrics while often
overlooking sustainability impact. This project demonstrates how AI can
extract sustainability signals from ESG disclosures to support
responsible investment decisions.

## Methodology

1.  Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
2.  Feature Engineering (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
3.  Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
4.  Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## Tech Stack

-   Python
-   Scikit-learn
-   Pandas / NumPy
-   NLTK / Gensim
-   Matplotlib
-   Jupyter Notebook
